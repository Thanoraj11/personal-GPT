Various functions performed by banks\n u recent trends in Indian Banking\n1.2 INTRODUCTION\nIndian Banking System for the last two centuries has seen many developments. till \n1955, the commercial banking was in the hands of private corporates. Setting up \nof State Bank of India and its subsidiaries and, thereafter nationalization of banks changed the structure of banks. With the start of financial reforms in 1991-92, new private banks came into existence and the full use of technology by these banks im-proved customer service in banks to a great extent. today, all banks are competing \nwith each other in regard to the development of new products matching with global standards. Banks offer savings, remittance, credit and other ancillary products to their customers. In addition, customers are also offered insurance and other risk management products. there are a large number of commercial bank branches and \ncooperative societies which are offering banking services to the people of India.\n1.3 NEED OF BANKING SERVICES\nNow-a-days, banking services are not a luxury but a necessity of life for everyone. the financial needs of the excluded are varied and distinct. they need access to CHAPTER 1\nSTRUCTURE OF INDIAN BANKING \nAND TYPES OF BANKS\n", "doc_id": "24090c1b-ebb5-4f20-bfe7-5d603eb171ea", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1666e5b921e161fd7710efd96b519084f56ee18897cfa9749aa11137d11f864f", "extra_info": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "Pages_from_BCBF_English_1.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1571, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "e78bc4d1-2c98-4e20-b1d2-98e90555db90"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "477dd45a-0f6d-4197-8370-484ed8d6229d": {"__data__": {"text": "6\nD:\\Bank-17Sep\\IGBC-17\\IGBC-17-01 SeRVeR Mk J.p. 16-11-2017/CR SM 19-12-2017/SM 23-12-2017/JItu-4-1-2018  6\nSTRUCTURE OF INDIAN BANKING AND TYPES OF BANKS\nsavings, insurance and most importantly credit. In equal measure, they also need \ncounselling as to how to access and use financial services. Given the poor economic status of the excluded, it is evident that the individual credit requirement could be small and initial demand for remittance and other facilities offered by the banks may not be much. also, these accounts may not have regular and high turnover. typically, this is low volume, low turnover and high number market. Needless to \nsay, however, that these people must be given access to formal financial services so that the overall development goals can be achieved.\nhowever, it was felt that the branch banking and electronic banking may not be \nappropriate models to reach the excluded people as financial inclusion involves \nfinancial education, counselling and building up of close relationship with people. In this background and in order to take banking services to the people living in unbanked and under banked areas, the Business Facilitator/Business Correspondent (BF/BF) Model was introduced.\nthe person or institution/company appointed as BF/BC will function as an extend-\ned arm of the bank branch in the area. the individual appointed by the bank or \na BC company is known as Business Correspondent agent (BCa)\n1. as a result of \nthis arrangement, the targeted population can access various financial services and financial education from the banks through these agents. It is, therefore, necessary for a BCa to be familiar with the basic/general banking knowledge, his/her roles and responsibilities in financial inclusion, technical and soft skills to perform his duties. as a first step, it is important to have a working knowledge about a bank and its basic functions.\n1.4 MEANING OF A BANK\na bank is a financial institution which acts as an intermediary between savers and investors or users of funds. a bank offers a number of financial services and prod-\nucts to its clients. It is easy to understand a bank from the various services it offers. the following is the illustrative list of services normally extended by banks to their customers:\n (i) a bank accepts deposits from the public in the form of Savings, Current and/\nor term Deposits.\n 1. In this book an Individual BC/BF is also referred as a BCa", "doc_id": "477dd45a-0f6d-4197-8370-484ed8d6229d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c4a243e44c5192d16a3034a7bbf578e3d119488d6d8e6c310ae0682db01eeff1", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Pages_from_BCBF_English_1.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2445, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "755cc14f-f9d1-472e-9ed1-a182295a47a7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7702ad19-fcfb-4e81-a6c8-c1a59437acbd": {"__data__": {"text": "7\nD:\\Bank-17Sep\\IGBC-17\\IGBC-17-01 SeRVeR Mk J.p. 16-11-2017/CR SM 19-12-2017/SM 23-12-2017/JItu-4-1-2018  7\nSTRUCTURE OF INDIAN BANKING AND TYPES OF BANKS\n (ii) It allows a customer to remit money or funds from one place to another in \nthe form of Demand Draft or Money transfer. these days, banks also offer \nto remit funds through electronic channels.\n (iii) It accepts instructions from the customer and makes, on their behalf, payment for utilities such as electricity bill, school fees etc.\n (iv) It accepts, on behalf of Government, tax payments.\n (v) It lends money for business, agriculture, purchase of house, purchase of vehicles etc.\n (vi) It transacts (buying and selling of foreign currency) in foreign exchange and helps business people and others receive or pay in Foreign currency for their export or import respectively. It buys and sells foreign currency as per the customer\u2019s needs.\n (vii) It offers safe deposit vault facilities for safe keeping of the customer\u2019s valuables.\n (viii) It operates atM machines which allow the customers to withdraw funds from their accounts round the clock.\n (ix) It offers credit/debit card facilities which help customers make payments for their purchases. It is also possible to borrow money by using credit cards.\n (x) Banks also sell mutual fund units and insurance products.\nthe above list would show the important role played by the banks in our day-to-day life. Banks are able to do all the above activities because they are financial interme-diaries. It is important to note that the primary function of banks is acceptance of money in the form of deposits and lending it to borrowers. a part of the deposits collected by the banks are also invested in bonds and securities. thus, deposit tak-\ning, lending and investment are the basic functions of a bank. the other activities \nlisted above could be treated as other functions of a bank.\n1.5 STRUCTURE OF INDIAN BANKING SYSTEM\nBanks in India are generally classified into various categories as follows.\n1.5-1 Scheduled Banks\nBanks can be either scheduled or non-scheduled.

Small \nFinance Banks (SFBs) are different from existing banks as they have to serve local areas to meet credit and remittance needs of small businesses, unorganised sector, low income households, farmers and migrant work force. It is intended that they should fulfil the needs of micro and small enterprises (MSes) with significant contribution to employment, value addition and exports in the Indian economy.\n1.5-5 Cooperative Banks\nCooperative banks are registered under the State Cooperative a ct with the r egistrar \nof Cooperative Societies. their main regulator is the State Government (or Central ", "doc_id": "6fcb59d0-76c3-4fc2-87d5-c1b944321419", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "24ce10a75459a5ee1079ecb6daca39b2d23ab8db8d9cb9e3bb7846be903c1c71", "extra_info": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Pages_from_BCBF_English_1.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2197, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "3d7d1952-60f3-4c59-b09c-407f115b406e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "54fc1624-9e22-40fd-b915-ffa3b86c4bfc": {"__data__": {"text": "11\nD:\\Bank-17Sep\\IGBC-17\\IGBC-17-01 SeRVeR Mk J.p. 16-11-2017/CR SM 19-12-2017/SM 23-12-2017/JItu-4-1-2018  11\nSTRUCTURE OF INDIAN BANKING AND TYPES OF BANKS\nGovernment in cases of the cooperative banks operating in more than one State). the \norganizational structure and management set-up of cooperative banks is based on \nthe cooperative principles. Cooperative Banks are classified into Urban Cooperative Banks, District Central Cooperative Banks, and Land Development Banks.\nCooperative Banks\u2019 balance sheets are much smaller as compared to commercial \nbanks. Not all the cooperative banks enjoy the scheduled status. Cooperative Banks operate through their branches and through the societies. Societies are not banks though some of them accept all types of deposits.\n1.6 FUNCTIONS OF BANKS\n1.6-1 Traditional Functions\n (a) Acceptance of Deposits :\n  a bank accepts money from its customers (members of the public). a customer \ncan keep his/her monies in current accounts where no interest is payable or in savings accounts (also known as savings deposit accounts) where nominal interest is paid. Normally, business firms/companies open current accounts which facilitate large number of transactions. In the case of individuals, and where commercial transactions may not be involved, savings accounts are opened. In both these cases, the amount deposited is repayable back to the customer as and when demanded/needed. Because of this aspect, current accounts and savings accounts are also known as demand deposits and cus-tomers can withdraw the funds by issuing cheques. Savings account holders are issued atM cards by using which they can withdraw cash in the atMs. the \naccounts, where the customers/savers can keep their funds for a longer time are called term deposits. term deposits could be in the form of fixed deposits, \nrecurring/cumulative deposits, monthly income deposits,  etc. Unlike current and savings bank deposits, wherein the amount deposited with the banks are repayable on demand, in the case of term deposits, the amounts deposited are, normally, repayable only after the expiry of the agreed term/period for which it is kept. there are, however, provisions for closing the deposit account \npre-maturely and withdrawing the amount subject to certain penal interest stipulations. term deposits constitute the largest portion of a bank\u2019s funds.", "doc_id": "54fc1624-9e22-40fd-b915-ffa3b86c4bfc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5c7882483867c36d8882da032b9c6702eddcc09b863b00af7fdc5b466bcedc86", "extra_info": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Pages_from_BCBF_English_1.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2369, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "e01d7efb-cb2f-404f-ae71-be01388b090d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a999d0b-558a-4f8e-8680-ad83bceab58f": {"__data__": {"text": "12\nD:\\Bank-17Sep\\IGBC-17\\IGBC-17-01 SeRVeR Mk J.p. 16-11-2017/CR SM 19-12-2017/SM 23-12-2017/JItu-4-1-2018  12\nSTRUCTURE OF INDIAN BANKING AND TYPES OF BANKS\n (b) Loans and Advances\n  Banks have to pay interest on the deposits at agreed rates of interest. In ad-\ndition, they have to meet their operational expenses. therefore, banks have \nto invest/lend the monies and earn interest. Lending money by way of loans and advances of various kinds is thus an important traditional function of a bank. the funds mobilized, in the form of deposits, and monies borrowed are \ndeployed by a bank as loans and advances to earn profits by way of interest spreads, i.e. the differential between the average interest rates on loans and on deposits. the interest income from loans and advances forms a major source \nof a bank\u2019s operating profit.\n  Banks lend in the form of Cash Credits, Overdrafts, Demand Loans and term \nLoans. Based on the borrower profile, loans can be classified as Corporate Loans, SMe advances, agricultural Loans, r etail Loans, Foreign Currency \nLoans, e ducational Loans, Vehicle Loans etc. Loans are also classified on the \nbasis of security. Security could be in the form of surety, pledge of Bank\u2019s Deposit receipts, shares and debentures, assignment of Life Insurance policies, Mortgage of immovable property, hypothecation of plant and machinery, raw material etc. a loan account with security is known as secured loan whereas a loan without security is known as clean loan (clean advance).\n  In order to repay depositors on demand and pay interest on borrowed funds and deposits, banks expect that all the borrowers who take the loans are prompt in payment of interest and repayment of principal amount. h owever, \nit is possible that on account a number of reasons, the interest and principal may get defaulted and become overdue. Loans and advances which remain overdue for more than a stipulated period is known as \u2018non-performing assets\u2019 (Npas). Npas cause loss of income (interest not being paid or recovered) and in some cases loss of the principal (amount lent). Lending, therefore, calls for good credit appraisal and requires adequate care, caution and supervision/monitoring by the bank to prevent loans turning overdue and eventually into Npas. Collection or recovery of dues/overdues is important for sustaining the viability of banks.\n (c) Remittance services :\n  Customers have to make payment for purchases in the place of their business or in the place of business of the vendor/seller. this calls for movement of ", "doc_id": "5a999d0b-558a-4f8e-8680-ad83bceab58f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7179ec8f96b0697e4815edd735a0b9f14cbfe848ddd6f28f7d036ed1891d014d", "extra_info": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Pages_from_BCBF_English_1.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2550, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "76964b27-c09c-4407-87e4-c4ba43957a98"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "79378ed9-daa1-400f-8cb2-bb044d090a77": {"__data__": {"text": "13\nD:\\Bank-17Sep\\IGBC-17\\IGBC-17-01 SeRVeR Mk J.p. 16-11-2017/CR SM 19-12-2017/SM 23-12-2017/JItu-4-1-2018  13\nSTRUCTURE OF INDIAN BANKING AND TYPES OF BANKS\nmoney from place to place. h owever, it may not be possible for a buyer to \ntravel from one place to another for making payments. Nor will it be con-\nvenient to carry large sums of money from one place to another place. It is, therefore, necessary that a good payment and settlement system should exist for enabling trade and commerce in the country. Banks perform the job of payment and settlements in the financial market. In this regard, Banks have branch network spread across various cities/regions/states. Some banks have branches and correspondent banks overseas as well. this network enables the \nbanks to remit funds of their customers, if needed, from one place to another in the same country or overseas by mail/telegraphic/electronic funds transfer or by issuing bank drafts. Banks charge appropriate fee from the remitting person for the service rendered. r emittance of funds by banks is fast, safe, \nsecure and cheap as compared to other modes of funds transfer, like post office money order (which is generally for small sums of money for personal use), physical transfer of money etc.\n1.6-2 Other Functions\n (a) Miscellaneous Services:\n  In addition to the above-mentioned core functions, banks also render other services, which are useful to customers, business firms and members of the society. these services include safe deposit lockers, safe custody of valuables; \nletters of credit and bank guarantees; collection of out-station cheques/bills/hundies; furnishing opinion reports on their customers; agency services for Government business, correspondent, trusteeship and executor\u2019s business. Banks charge a commission or fee on such services, which provides them with non-interest income adding to their profits.\n (b) e lectronic Banking:\n  In the wake of the recent strides in information and communication technolo-gies, almost all banking operations have now been computerized. Information technology and It driven systems have been adopted by most commercial \nbanks both in private and public sectors and most of the banks in the coop-erative sector also.

Internal house-keeping is done accurately and much faster. these new banking channels \nhave ensured that the customer need not necessarily go to the branches for cash withdrawal, deposit of cheques, obtaining account statement etc., but has access to other channels such as atM, Credit/Debit Card or internet.\n  the Information and Communication technology (ICt ) is playing an \nimportant role in financial inclusion efforts. It will also ensure that a large number of accounts are handled by the banking system more easily than in the past.\n1.7 REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF BANKING  IN INDIA\nReserve Bank of India:\nthe activities of the banking sector are supervised, controlled and regulated by the \nreserve Bank of India. It plays an important role in the monetary and banking \nstructure of the country. the r eserve Bank of India (rBI) was established on a pril \n1, 1935 as the central bank of the country. It acts as the note issuing authority, bank-er\u2019s bank and banker to Government, and to promote the growth of the economy within the framework of the general economic policy of the Government consistent with the need for maintenance of price stability. Considering the dominance of agriculture in the Indian economy, the r eserve Bank was assigned a greater role to \nexpand and coordinate the credit facilities available to the agricultural sector. the \nreserve Bank of India\u2019s role in rural credit relating to its promotional, finance and ", "doc_id": "64cee884-9fef-45f8-ac0a-c24e801b6d77", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "abcd421f0d125c3a13ee32db508c7d2a33fbe27af98dd21b0de645e4176316f9", "extra_info": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Pages_from_BCBF_English_1.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2407, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "06e9cfa8-d5b7-47f5-bcae-c50f8f45b5f4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "30d6d62d-561d-4465-bbb7-26251f3bb2f1": {"__data__": {"text": "15\nD:\\Bank-17Sep\\IGBC-17\\IGBC-17-01 SeRVeR Mk J.p. 16-11-2017/CR SM 19-12-2017/SM 23-12-2017/JItu-4-1-2018  15\nSTRUCTURE OF INDIAN BANKING AND TYPES OF BANKS\nregulatory functions has undergone a change with the formation of NaBarD in \n1982. the r eserve Bank continues to retain its essential regulatory controls.\nNABARD: the Committee to r eview arrangements for Institutional Credit for \nagriculture and rural Development (CraFICarD) under the Chairmanship of \nShri B. Sivaraman recommended the establishment of a separate bank at the nation-al level under the umbrella of rBI to be known as National Bank for agriculture and r ural Development (NaBarD) as a refinancing agency for the entire rural \ncredit system. NaBarD came into existence on 12 July 1982 by transferring the agricultural credit functions of rBI and refinance functions of the then agricultural refinance and Development Corporation (arDC). Functions of NaBarD \ncategorized broadly into three heads: Financial, Developmental and Supervision. Financial function includes both Direct Finance and r efinance functions. More \nthan 50% of the rural credit is disbursed by the Co-operative Banks and r egional \nrural Banks. NaBarD is responsible for regulating and supervising the functions \nof Co-operative banks and rrBs.\n1.8 RECENT TRENDS IN BANKING\nthe Indian banking system presently consists of public sector banks, private sector banks, foreign banks, regional rural banks, urban cooperative banks and rural co-operative banks. the major market share is that of the public sector banks.\nthe banking sector is laying greater emphasis on providing improved services to their clients and also upgrading their technology infrastructure, in order to enhance the customer\u2019s overall experience as well as give banks a competitive edge.\n (a) Greater Operational Freedom given to Banks:\n  rBI has deregulated interest rates and given operational freedom to banks for \nfixing interest rates on advances as well as deposits as per their assets- Liabili-\nties Management (aLM) policies. rBI expects banks to be more transparent \nin regard their base rates and other policy matters.\n (b) Emergence of Universal Banking\n  Universal banking means offering all banking products & services (both fee \nbased and fund based services) under one roof. Banks are making lower profit margins on their lending business with increased competition. therefore, \nbanks are increasingly focusing on fee-based income to make up for this falling ", "doc_id": "30d6d62d-561d-4465-bbb7-26251f3bb2f1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5f9c437f7174281dd53d1f8cfc0d2810d5d89d23bd8508a3422fd954488d30dd", "extra_info": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Pages_from_BCBF_English_1.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2487, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b9aee9a3-beda-4bce-a5d8-8762bbd6364b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "092eb71c-c047-48bd-bd28-e48c16ba2edf": {"__data__": {"text": "16\nD:\\Bank-17Sep\\IGBC-17\\IGBC-17-01 SeRVeR Mk J.p. 16-11-2017/CR SM 19-12-2017/SM 23-12-2017/JItu-4-1-2018  16\nSTRUCTURE OF INDIAN BANKING AND TYPES OF BANKS\ninterest income.

Introduction of p radhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (pMJ-\nDY), p radhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Scheme, p radhan Mantri Suraksha Bima \nYojana are aiming to provide financial products to all such people who have been excluded so far. Using services of Business Correspondents and Business Facilitators for providing banking services in the remotest areas have been a success attempt in this regard. Setting up of new p ayment Banks and Small \nFinance Banks would boost financial inclusion to a great extent. the entry of \na substantial number of new, differentiated banks is an overarching growth driver for the financial distribution segment. the other three growth drivers \nfor the segment include providing an impetus to change in the delivery and consumption of financial services, demographic factors, technology changes and regulation. as non-banking digital companies and new banks, premised on low cost-high tech models to deal with low value-high volume customers, make their mark in the banking universe, the delivery of financial services must be reimagined by the supply side.\n (d) Increased Use of Technology:\n  a doption of new technology in banks has considerably changed the bank-\ning culture itself. technological evolution increased automation of banking \noperations which enabled off-site banking through atMs, internet banking, payment of utilities through banks, travel reservation through banks, etc. Core Banking Solution (CBS) implemented in almost all banks has enabled anywhere, anytime banking. Use of mobile banking is increasing day-by-day. remittances of funds through rt GS and NeFt have facilitated the individ-\nuals and also the traders. Banks are also entering into the \u201cwallet\u201d banking business for penetrating its outreach to the vast population of the country.
