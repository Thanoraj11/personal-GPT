INTRODUCTION  \nCredit is a loan or a debt of whatever form sanctioned by a bank to its customer. The word appraisal is \nsynonymous with assessment, evaluation, judgment, review and consideration. Credit Appraisal is the \nprocess by which the lender asses the credit worthiness of the borrower. The process revolves around \ncharacter, collateral capability and capacity, etc. It takes into account various factors like income of the \napplicants, number of dependents, monthly expenditure, repayment capacity, employment history, number \nof years of service and other factors which affect credit rating of the borrower. In the unit we shall discuss \nthe process in brief to be carried out while appraising any credit proposal.  \n \n23.2 CREDIT APPRAISAL  \nCredit appraisal is a process of critical evaluation of a loan request by a prospective borrower. The primary \nobjective of evaluation is safety and liquidity of funds lent and profitability from the credit extended. \nThe lender uses certain standard tools like analysis of the borrower\u2019s financial statements, weighing \nthe prospects of the applicant\u2019s product in the market juxtaposed to the industry, viability of customers \nbusiness and if the credit will remain as a performing asset. In this connection appraisal means something \nmore than the verification and validation of the data and information that the applicant submits to the \nbank. An appraisal is undertaken for ensuring that a credit is good.  \nWhat is good credit? For convenience sake let us define a \u2018good credit\u2019 is one which is not a Non- \nPerforming Asset. An account will not be a NPA if repayments in the account are regular (not overdue), \nthe interest payments are in time and regular, the account is not over drawn and the funds are used for \nthe intended purposes. If the objective of appraisal is \u2018good credit\u2019 then it should focus on evaluating the \nproposal to see if the above conditions are feasible and if the proponent or the borrower has the skill and \ninclination to keep the credit \u2018good\u2019.  \nThe essence of credit appraisal is that it measures the risk inherent in the proposal and comes to judgment \nto sanction or reject the proposal based on the assessment of the information, the applicant and the project. \nCredit appraisal which was mostly a matter of judgment some years ago has undergone changes in two \ndimensions. One, it has become credit risk appraisal rather than credit appraisal in that the emphasis has \nshifted from a subjective evaluation of the quality of credit to appraising the risk inherent in the proposal \nand if the proposal will be acceptable given the risk appetite of the lender. Second, the appraisal or \nmeasurement of the quality of the credit and risk has become more objective than judgmental.  \n \n23.3 CREDIT APPRAISAL TECHNIQUES  \nCredit appraisal is a continuous process that starts when an applicant walks into the branch and that  \nculminates in credit delivery.

Information should be well defined and it is important \nto ask for information that is essential for decision making. Bank should be able to distinguish between \nrelevant and irrelevant pieces of information. An information overload is not a real help in decision \nmaking and often derails appraisal process. This involves several measures:  \n(i) Information provided by the applicant is verified with the supporting documents, where possible. For \ninstance in case of a company the information about its incorporation, the powers of the company \nand its management can be verified from its certificate of incorporation and the memorandum of \narticles. Similarly, its financial details can be verified through its financial statements.  \n(ii) Another important modality is field verification. This requires visiting the factory and/ or office of \nthe applicant. The objective is to verify the status of the activities of the applicant \u2013 both in respect \nof its nature and also its level. It is also an opportunity to learn about the management skills of the \napplicant or the quality of management of the enterprise.  \n(iii) Also, important part of validation process is verifying all the required approvals and licenses both \non record and on display at the premises.  \n(iv) Another hygiene factor is the applicant\u2019s capacity to borrow. The banker must be sure that the \nperson requesting credit has the authority to request a loan and the legal capacity to sign a loan \nagreement. For example, in case of a company a resolution of the Board of Directors would establish \nthe authority to borrow.  \n23.3.2 Credit Risk \nCredit risk is defined as the possibility of borrower/counterparty default. Default can occur because \nof business failure or because the borrower\u2019s wilful actions. The latter is a question of integrity of the \nborrower. While in the past lenders relied on market reports (credit reports from bankers and others) to \ntake a call on this issue, the present day lenders rely on credit reports for individual borrowers and credit \nrating of companies/firms by the rating agencies and their own credit rating.  \nA default event can be triggered by external, internal or a combination of both external and internal \nfactors. Internal to the firm (borrower) are issues such as inefficient management, bad financial decisions, \nmarketing failures etc. The lender assesses the quality of management by looking at the composition of \nthe promoters, Board of Directors, experience of the Directors in the industry, the CEO\u2019s experience and \nexpertise in the industry and other key technical and managerial personnel. Poor financial management \ncould be caused by poor cash flow management and bad collections. At times less than optimal financial \nassistance by the lender or over financing could all lead to problems.  \n23.3.3 Credit Risk Rating \nCredit risk rating or credit rating is one of the credit appraisal tools. In this method credit risk is assessed \nin the form rating by assigning marks to different parameters and evaluating on the basis of some threshold \npreset standards/marks. A credit risk rating model assigns grades/marks to known risk components. Each \nrisk component is assigned weights relative to the importance of the item in arriving at a credit risk score \nfor the borrower. The borrower\u2019s financial standing and performance are rated for scoring. Additionally \nthe management, quality of maintenance of accounts and similar factors that do not lend themselves to \nstatistical measurements are also rated.

If the credit rating \nscore is below the cutoff point stipulated by the management of the lending bank the credit proposal \nwill not be taken up for further processing.  \n(ii) The lender will also check if the purpose of the loan fits in with the credit policy of the bank and  \nthe proposed activity of the borrower is not on the banned or restricted list of the lending bank.  \n(iii) The lender will also need to check if the sanction of the loan will breach any of the concentration \nlimits prescribed by the bank in respect of group, industry or limit for individual exposure.  \nThe proposal would be rejected if it does not pass any one of these tests.  \n23.3.5 Aspects of Appraisal (7 C\u2019s) \nThere are four cardinal parameters of lending. These are as follows:  \n(a) Evaluation of creditworthiness of the borrower,  \n(b) Considering the purpose of the loan,  \n(c) Verifying the cash flows and source of repayment, and  \n(d) Assessing the security/collateral security.  \nFor satisfying these parameters holistically, it is important to look into following aspects: \nCreditworthiness, Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, Conditions, and Cash flows. \nThese are called as 7 C\u2019s of appraisal.  \n(i) Evaluation of Creditworthiness: The first thing that a lender would look at is the applicant\u2019s \ncreditworthiness. If the applicant is an individual applying for a personal loan or home loan, his/her \ncredit history is checked up with credit information reports provided by Credit Information Companies \nlike CIBIL. The lender will also perform the due diligence exercise and examine the individual\u2019s \ncharacter capacity etc. through market enquiries, In case of partnership concerns, Private Limited \nand Public Limited companies, the financial soundness is assessed from their financial statements. \nCross verification of data can be made, among other things, by undertaking discrete enquiries/search \nin CERSAI records, ROC, RBI defaulters\u2019 list, CRILC etc.  \nRepayment of loan depends not only on the intentions but also on the ability to pay. Thus the financial \ncondition of the borrower is evaluated based on the income and net worth in case of an individual. \nIn case of businesses, however, their past financial statements are analysed.  \nTill about 1990, bank credit was considered a scarce commodity and, therefore, there was a strong focus \non the need to optimally use this resource towards the creation of primary assets, which are known \nas primary security charged in favour of the lending bank. With gradual liberalisation, commercial \nbanks have begun providing credit to other sectors and even for those commodities which are not in \nthe manufacturing sectors. In the monetary policy of 1997-98, RBI declared the MPBF method as \noptional and suggested that commercial banks may evolve their own rational methods for financing. \nRBI suggested \u2018Cash Budget\u2019 method as an alternative option. Due to non-performing asset norms, \ncredit appraisal techniques are increasingly focused on the assessment of repayment capacity of the \nborrowers, which in turn depends on their cash generating ability.  \n(ii) Purpose of the Loan: Purpose of establishing a business enterprise may differ. Purpose is different \nfrom the line of business.

Another person may start a business with a long term interest \nin it and grow it. People may be interested in starting a business induced by the success of other \npersons. Clearly, the first two are business strategies whereas the last one is rather speculative. For \nall the three purposes whether the proponent has the core competency for the given line of business \nwill be a pointer towards success.  \nBusiness related loans are required for different purposes, depending on the circumstances and the \nstages of the business. For starting or expanding a business enterprise capital investment is required \nfor acquiring land/ building, plant and machinery, etc. The entrepreneur at this stage needs funds for \nlong term investment. For running a business, funds are required for purchase of raw material/ goods \nand other consumable goods and services, payments for labour and staff, other working expenses, \nand for extending credit to the buyers. Thus, for running the business the entrepreneur needs loan \nfor meeting the working capital requirements. The banker must be convinced that the customer has \na well-defined purpose for requesting credit and a serious intention to be in business.  \nIndividuals also need loans for meeting different types of requirements arising during their lifetime. \nCategory of requirements include loans for marriage, major illness and education. These are high \nexpenditure events and often loans are required to meet these requirements. Another purpose is to \nacquire a house, for which individuals require loans that facilitates persons to leverage their savings \npotential for this purpose. Lastly, in today\u2019s times individuals aspire to acquire consumer durables \nand lifestyle goods like vehicles, air conditioners, consumer durables, etc. Acquiring these goods \nthrough loans helps an individual to enjoy the comforts of these while they repay loans out of future \nearnings. The purpose for which the customer is requesting a loan must be clarified to the lender\u2019s \nsatisfaction.  \n(iii) Security/ Collateral: Collateral does not add to the financial viability of a proposal. Collateral does not \naffect the quality of the credit and is not part of the external or internal factors that have a relationship \nwith the quality of the credit. Yet collateral has a very definite place once an event of default occurs. \nIt is an exit option. Thus if the business and/or the principal security has failed to produce the cash \nflows to service the loan and the account has become overdue or non-performing, collateral offers a \nway out for the lender to recover through enforcement of security. The assets obtained as collateral \nshould satisfy certain criteria to be of value to the lender. Enforceability and enforcing of collaterals \nare important. The legal system is so designed and so misused that by the time - if at all- a judgment to \nenforce the security is obtained a long period of time would have already passed. Certain factors that \nare relevant are: age, condition, and degree of specialization of the assets. Technological obsolescence \nis an important factor to be considered.  \n(iv) Cash Flow: The key feature of any loan application centers on one issue: Does the proposed business \nhave the ability to generate enough cash to repay the loan? In general, business firms have only four \nsources to draw upon to repay their loans:  \n(i) cash flows generated from sales or other income,  \n(ii) the sale or liquidation of assets, or  \n(iii) funds raised by issuing debt or equity securities ( borrowing)  \n(iv) additional capital infusion.  \nAny of these sources may provide sufficient cash to repay a loan. However, lenders would prefer that \nrepayment comes from the cash flow from business activity or in other words profits generated. This \nis because asset sales can weaken the business capacity.

Normally fresh capital is insisted at the time of reworking the \nterms of credit as the infusion is a clear indication of difficulties in the venture. The cash flow analysis \nis useful in understanding clearly the sources of a borrower\u2019s cash flow. As far as bankers/lenders are \nconcerned it would be ideal if most of cash comes from operations (sales oriented). Evidently if a \nsubstantial proportion of cash inflow happens due to sale of assets (investing activities) or borrowing \nor issuing debt (financing activities), the borrower may find it difficult to generate cash in the future \nwhich will make the bank loan exposed to more risk.  \nIn case of individuals too the lenders need to look into the source of repayment. This should normally \nbe a regular source of income like salary, professional earnings, rent or interest income. Adequacy \nand sustainability of these incomes need to be looked into.  \n \n23.4 METHODS OF ASSESSMENT OF LOANS  \nCommercial loans, including project loans (having long repayment period), require specialised skills for \nassessment, disbursal and monitoring. Such loans are usually handled by specialised branches or \nspecialised teams at central/ nodal points. On the other hand, retail loans, which have been largely \nstandardised by banks, form a prominent part of the activities of branches. These loans are substantially \ntechnology driven because of their large volume and small ticket size. The standardisation covers not \nonly in respect of application form, information required from the customer, terms and conditions, legal \ndocumentation, etc., but also the processing of loan proposals, where the data are fed into the system \nwhich generates the score card for decisions to be taken by the sanctioning officer. The monitoring of \nsuch loans is also computerised.  \nAssessment of loans for different purposes is done in different manner as the factors affecting these differ \nin several respects. Broadly, these can be categorised in the following types:  \nA. Loans for business enterprises : \n(i) For Working Capital Purposes  \n(ii) For Capital Expenditure  \nB. Loans for individuals : \n(i) For Housing Purposes  \n(ii) For Vehicles/ Consumer Durables  \n \n23.5 ASSESSMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL  \nFunds required to sustain working cycle/ production cycle of any unit is called working capital. Working \ncapital for any manufacturing unit means the total amount of circulating funds required for the continuous \noperations of the unit as a going concern. The working capital management or short term financial \nmanagement which is concerned with decisions relating to current assets and current liabilities with \nmajor thrust, of course, is on the management of current assets.  \nThe key difference between long term financial management and working capital management is in terms \nof timing of cash. While long term financial decisions like buying capital equipment or issuing debentures \ninvolve cash flow over an extended period of time (5 to 15 years), short term financial decisions typically \ninvolve cash flows within a year or within the operating cycle.

Acquisition \nof items such as Land, Plant & Machinery, building, furniture, etc. requires capital or long term debt.  \nInvestments in these assets represent that part of firm\u2019s capital which is blocked on permanent or fixed \nbasis and is called fixed capital. Business also needs funds for short-term purposes such as purchase of raw \nmaterial, payment of wages and other day-to-day expenses etc. These funds are known as working capital.  \nIn simple words, working capital refers to that part of the firm\u2019s funds that is required for financing short- \nterm or current assets such as cash, debtors & inventories. Working capital for any manufacturing unit is \nthe total amount of circulating funds required for the continuous operations of the unit on a going basis. \nThe funds used in production are recouped from sale of final products at the end of the production cycle \nand are available for use in the next production cycle. Working capital can therefore be called operating \ncapital or short term capital as well.  \nThere are two concepts of working capital:  \n(i) Gross working capital  \n(ii) Net working capital  \n(i) Gross Working Capital: It is the capital invested in total current assets of the enterprise. Current assets \nare tangible movable assets that are recoverable in cash or sold or consumed or turned over during \nthe operating cycle usually not exceeding one year. The gross working capital concept is financial \nor going concern concept whereas net working capital is an accounting concept of working capital. \nBoth the concepts have their own merits.  \nThe gross concept:  \n(a) Enables the enterprise to provide correct amount of working capital at the right time.  \n(b) Helps management to know the amount invested in total current assets with which it has to \noperate. \n(ii) Net Working Capital: It tells the business about how the assets are funded. In a narrow sense, the \nterm working capital refers to the net working capital (NWC) or liquid surplus which is the difference \nbetween current assets and current liabilities. It is the excess of long term funds over long term uses. \nWhen the current assets exceed the current liabilities, the NWC is positive and when the current \nliabilities are more than the current assets, it would become negative. The net working capital should \nbe higher than 1:1 to ensure sufficient liquidity and availability of working funds.  \nThe net working capital concept, however, is also important for following reasons:  \n(a) It is qualitative concept, which indicates the firm\u2019s ability to meet to its operating expenses  \nand short-term liabilities.  \n(b) It indicates the margin of protection available to the short term creditors.  \n(iii) Working Capital Gap: It is a concept used in the Indian banking sector to determine the amount of \nworking capital limits the bank would make available to the borrower.

Other expenses  \nWorking capital is not something static. It changes with the size of the company, the phase of operations, \nprofits accrued and retained and a host of other factors. As a general rule, banks try to fund the gap or \nextend what they call need based financial assistance. The premise is that with need based financing \nthere is little scope for diversion or misuse of funds as financing is just adequate and not in excess of \nrequirements. And if the finance is inadequate it leads to production problems and eventually leads a \ncompany to sickness.  \nVarious factors influence the need of working capital in a business. These are mainly: Nature of business,  \nSize of business, Production Policy, Seasonal variations, Operating/ Working Cycle.  \n \n23.5.3 Operating/ Working Capital Cycle \nThe duration from the purchase of raw materials through production to finished goods to sales and sales \nrealisation is the time period for which working capital funds are required. Once sales proceeds are \nreceived in cash, this money is available for purchase of raw materials and continuing production. The \nwhole process is repeated again. Because of the cyclical nature of this entire process, the production \nperiod is called the operation cycle.

There \nwill be time gaps between purchase of raw material and production; production and sales; sales and \nrealization of cash etc. There will always be some time before and after order is issued before the raw \nmaterial is received. Hence, there is a need to keep stock of goods at every stage. This requires purchase \nof raw materials ahead of their need for production. Similarly, there is a build-up of stock of finished \ngoods before these are despatched to the customer. There is certain process time for conversion of raw \nmaterials to finished goods.

It is implicit that \nthe firm will have to submit an acceptable business plan, in the form of projected financial statements, \nto the bank. Thereafter, the assessment of working capital needs is made based on the past trends, the \nend use of funds and the estimated requirement of additional funds as revealed by the firm\u2019s business \nplan or the cash budget, in cases of those firms which have a marked seasonality of operations. These \nmethods require the preparation of:  \n(a) Projected financial statements (b) Projected fund flow statements  \n(c) Projected cash flow statements/cash budgets  \nBanks are free to evolve appropriate system for assessing the working capital credit needs of borrowers. \nThese may be explained in their loan policy.

The banks may decide on \ntheir own as to which items should be included for consideration as current assets or current \nliabilities.  \n(d) It enunciated the concept of Maximum Permissible Bank Finance (MPBF) for assessment of working \ncapital. \n(e) It suggested different methods of funding current assets to be adopted depending on the size of credit \nrequired. \n(f) First Method of Lending : In this method, the contribution by the borrowing unit is fixed at a minimum \n25% of the working capital gap from long-term funds. The bank finances a maximum of 75% of the \ngap; the balance amount should come from long-term sources. This would reduce the reliance of \nthe borrowers on bank borrowings by ploughing back of more internal cash generated. This method \nof lending gives a current ratio of only 1:17, evidently on low side. This approach was considered \nsuitable for relatively new units set up by first time entrepreneurs and for sick/weak units as supportive \nmeasure. \n(g) Second Method of Lending : In order to graduate the borrowers to enhance their contributions to \nworking capital, they are placed under the second method of lending recommended by the Tandon \nCommittee. This would give a minimum current ratio of 1.33:1. Under this method, the borrower is \nrequired to provide for a minimum of 25% of total current assets out of long-term funds. A certain \nlevel of credit for purchases and other current liabilities will be available to fund the build-up of \ncurrent assets and the bank will provide the balance (MPBF). However, total liabilities inclusive of \nbank finance would never exceed 75% of gross current assets. In case a borrower is not in a position \nto work under the second method of lending immediately, the excess borrowing is segregated and \ntreated as a working capital term loan repayable in instalments over a period of time. To induce the \nborrowers to repay this loan, bank may charge higher rate of interest on it.  \n(h) Third Method of Lending : Under this method, the contribution from long term funds would be to \nthe extent of the entire core current assets (which was defined by the Committee as representing the \nabsolute minimum level of raw materials, process stock, finished goods and stores which are in the \npipeline to ensure continuity of production) and a minimum of 25% of the balance current assets. \nThe balance current assets only would be financed through bank finance for working capital after \nnetting off other current liabilities meeting the current assets. In other words this method envisaged \nfunding of additional requirement due to fluctuations in current asset levels due to various factors \nseasonal or occasional.  \n(This Method was not accepted for implementation and hence is of only academic Interest.)

This method requires that the borrower \nhas necessary infrastructure in place to submit the required information periodically in time. The scope \nof internal MIS should be satisfactory and commensurate with the level of operations. The borrower \nmust have a finance professional and computerised environment. Cash Flow based lending method is \npopular in developed countries.  \nA cash budget is a statement of cash receipts and cash payments. It is distinct from the cash flow statement, \nin as much as the latter deals with both cash and non-cash funds, while the cash budget deals with cash \ntransactions only. Also, a cash budget is a projection into the future, as against a cash flow statement that \nis usually historical in nature. Cash budget is a substitute for the operating cycle method for the assessment \nof working capital.  \nCash-budget statement typically would comprise of projected receipts and payments grouped under \nfollowing four categories based on their purpose:  \n(i) Business operations;  \n(ii) Non-business operations;  \n(iii) Cash flow from capital accounts; and  \n(iv) Sundry items.  \nFor the purpose of determining the requirement of working capital finance, the cash-budget statement  \nfor business operations is relevant.

A cash budget is usually prepared for short periods, i.e. a week/ a fortnight/ a month or a \nquarter. For a more precise assessment determining working capital requirement on quarterly basis is \npreferred.  \nCash - budget statement projection consists of the following steps in sequence when prepared for a quarter.  \n\uf02d Expected receipts and payments during the first, the second and the third month are recorded.  \n\uf02d Position of the cash surplus/ deficit is computed for monthly intervals. A surplus is generated if the \nreceipts exceed the payments, and a cash deficit occurs if payments are more than the receipts during the \nmonth.The opening cash balance for the first month is adjusted against the cash surplus/ deficit \nduring that month. The adjusted figure is the closing balance at the end of the first month, which becomes \nthe opening balance for the next month, viz., the second month.  \n\uf02d A cash surplus generated during a month results in higher closing cash balance vis-\u00e0-vis the opening \nbalance of the month. Conversely, a cash deficit during the month would cause lower closing cash  \nbalance as compared to the opening balance.  \n\uf02d If the enterprise has a net position on borrowed funds (i.e. the company maintains a cash credit/ \noverdraft account), a cash surplus generated during a month brings down the level of the borrowed \nfunds at the end of the month.  \nCash budgets are essential for assessment of working capital needs in situations like those mentioned \nbelow: \n(i) Opening Letter of Credit,  \n(ii) Ad hoc working capital facility,  \n(iii) Bill financing,  \n(iv) Financing construction activities,  \n(v) Financing seasonal industries,  \n(vi) Financing tea/ coffee/ rubber plantation,  \n(vii) Financing sugar manufacturing,  \n(viii) Financing software development activities,  \n(ix) Financing cardamom processing, rice milling, etc.  \nUnder this method the peak cash deficit amount is the total working capital finance to be provided to \nthe borrower by the bank.

The main advantages of cash budget system are:  \n1. The customer plans his cash requirements in advance and in case his bank is unable to sanction \nadditional funds, the customer can seek alternative sources well in advance.  \n2. The banker is in close touch with his customers. He would, therefore, be able to spot any danger \nsignals quickly and initiate corrective action in time.  \n3. The banker can plan his resources to meet expected credit demands. Credit planning would thus \nbecome a meaningful exercise.  \n23.5.6 Assessment of Non-fund Based Facilities \nWhile ascertaining the credit needs of the borrower, the banker should assess both the fund based and \nnon-fund based limits required by him together and sanction them as a package. The non-fund based \nlimits are normally of two types: (i) bank guarantees, (ii) letters of credit.  \n \n(i) Bank Guarantees (BG)  \nFor assessing bank guarantee required by a borrower, details such as the nature of guarantee, its purpose, \nthe particulars of the contract period and the amount for which the guarantee is sought are collected and \nassessed from the aspect of creditworthiness of the customer and his relationship with the bank for \nsanctioning the guarantee facility. Appropriate conditions with regard to cash margin and security, \nregistration of charge with ROC, in case the customer is a corporate, are laid down in the sanction to protect \nthe interestsof the bank, in the event of a default of the customer to fulfill his part of the obligation of \nthe contract relating to which the bank guarantee has been issued and the liability thereon likely to be \ncrystallized on the banker.  \nThere could be occasions when the customer needs a limit in case of guarantees. This is similar to Cash \nCredit or Overdraft Limits. The customer has to operate within the limit so approved and the limit, like \nall bank facilities is subject to yearly review. The assessment of regular Bank Guarantee Limits would \ndepend upon the nature of activity of the borrower, the nature, purpose and type of guarantees required \nin such an activity and the duration of such guarantee.  \nBank must clearly understand various types of guarantees required in the line of activity and classify them \ninto Financial and Performance guarantees. The nature, amount and period of bank guarantee required \ndepends on the purpose for which the guarantee is to be issued. Hence, to determine the bank guarantee \nlimit required by a customer it is important to assess various purposes for which the borrower would \nrequire guarantees. Some of the purposes for which guarantees are usually required are enumerated below.

For \nexample earnest money guarantee will depend upon the number and value of tenders to be applied \nfor by the company, the percentage of success in getting the tender awarded and the duration of such \nguarantees.  \n(iii) Guarantees for Export Quota: Similarly in case of guarantees issued favouring Apparel Export \nPromotion council for release of garment export quota, the guarantee amount is related to the value \nof quota applied and allotted, which in turn will depend upon the level of exports proposed in the \nensuing year and other factors.  \n(iv) Guarantees for Tax Liabilities: In certain cases the borrower may require guarantees to be issued \nfavouring Excise, Income-Tax authorities against disputed liabilities. Requirement of such guarantees \nis ascertained based on the level of such disputed liabilities and the demand made by the concerned \ndepartments.  \n(v) Guarantees for Import of Capital Goods: The borrower may also require guarantees for import of \ncapital goods on concessional import duty under various schemes of Government, whose requirement \ncan be determined on a case to case basis.  \n(vi) Guarantees for Advance Payments:  Wherever the borrower is accepting advance payment from \npurchasers and is required to furnish bank guarantees in lieu thereof, the amount of such guarantees \nwill be proportional to the amount of such advance payments that will be outstanding, which in turn \nwill be dependent on the level of sales.  \nThe cumulative requirements will indicate the amount of Bank Guarantee limits for various purposes.  \n \nIllustration  \nPQR Ltd. undertakes government contracts for fabrication of bridges.

Term loans are also extended for \nacquisition of a capital asset like machinery, equipment, factory or office premises, vehicles, etc. on \nstandalone basis. Repayment of a term loan comes from the future earnings of the unit (i.e. cash surplus \ngenerated out of the business), in contrast to the working capital facility that is paid out of sales realisation \nfrom the operating stocks. Normally, the term loans are repayable in instalments over a period ranging \nfrom 3 to 10 years. The credit risk, therefore, is greater in case of term loan than in case of working \ncapital finance.  \nWhere a term loan is considered for a new business to be established, it requires assessment of project \ncost and means of finance. While in case of term loan for standalone acquisition of a capital asset would \nrequire assessing the cost of acquisition of that asset. In both cases, it is necessary to assess the future \ncash surplus from the business operations that would be available to service the term loan viz. for meeting \nthe interest and repayment instalments for the term loan.  \n \n23.6.1 Cost of Project and Means of Finance \nAssessment of project cost requires estimating the cost of acquisition of capital assets, cost of construction \nof building, and any other related expenditure. Besides, in the project cost the amount of working capital \nmargin required is also included as this is also to be funded from long term sources. Assessment of funding \nof a project requires determination of various funding sources that are available to the entrepreneur and \nestimating the amount of funds expected from these. A typical statement of the Cost of the Project and \nSources of Finance is tabulated as shown below.

For instance, preliminary and pre-operative \nexpenses are not funded by banks but are required to be met from the entrepreneur\u2019s own sources. \nSecondly, for the assets that are funded by banks through the term loans, they require a part of the cost \nto be met by the borrower\u2019s own fund as margin contribution. Thus, the total margin requirement for \nvarious assets funded through term loans from bank will also need to be met by the borrower from own \nfunds. Bankers also look at the debt-equity structure in case of a project to satisfy about the level of \nleveraging being within reasonable range.  \n \n23.6.2 Assessment of Term Loan Limits \nIt will be noted that for determining the term loan requirement of a borrower the bank needs to assess \nthe total project cost first. This requires estimating for each of the items the requirements. This exercise \nneeds an understanding of the nature of each of these items connected with setting up of the project.  \n(i) Land & site development : adequacy, lease or free hold, reasonability of estimates for civil works, \netc. The cost of land & site development is the sum of the following:-  \na.

Cost of laying approach roads and internal roads  \ne. Cost of compound wall and gates  \nf. Cost of tube wells, etc.  \nThe cost of land varies considerably from one location to another and it may be very high in urban \nand even semi-urban locations, it is relatively low in rural locations. Likewise, the expenditure on \nsite development too varies widely depending on the location and topography of the land.  \n(ii) Building: Buildings of different types such as factory, administrative, godown, canteen, time house, guest house, \nstaff quarters, silos, tanks, wells, chests, garages, sewers, other civil engineering works, etc. may be required \ndepending on the type, size and location of the plant. The need for each type of buildings needs to be examined. \nEstimates should be based on plinth area, the rates for various types of structures, the types of materials to be \nused, etc. The costs must be reasonable, and duly certified by approved architect. These rates, of course, vary \nwith the location to some extent.

However, a certain part of the working capital requirement has to come from \nlong-term sources of finance. This is referred to as \u201cmargin money for working capital\u201d and is an \nimportant element of the project cost. The margin money may sometimes be used for meeting \noverruns in the project cost. This leads to a working capital problem (sometimes a crisis) when the \nproject is commissioned. To mitigate this problem, financial institutions stipulate that a portion of \nthe loan amount, equal to the margin money for working capital, be blocked initially so that it can \nbe released when the project is completed. It is the NWC available in the system from long term \nsources. \n(x) Initial cash losses : Most of the projects incur cash losses in the initial years. Yet, the promoters \ntypically do not disclose the initial cash losses because they want the project to appear attractive \nto the financial institutions and investing public. Failure to make adequate provision for such cash \nlosses in the project generally affects the liquidity position and impairs the operations. Hence \nprudence calls for making a provision, overt or covert, for the estimated initial cash losses.  \nThe next stage is ascertaining various sources of finance including both equity and borrowings \nincluding term loans from banks/ financial institutions.  \n(xi) Sources of Finance : To meet the cost of the project, the following sources of finance are available:  \n\uf02d Share capital  \n\uf02d Term loans  \n\uf02d Debenture capital  \n\uf02d Deferred credit  \n\uf02d Incentive sources  \n\uf02d Miscellaneous sources  \n(a) Share capital may be equity (owners and equity shareholders) or preference capital.  \n(b) Term loans are provided by banks and financial institutions. They may be in Indian rupees \nor in foreign currency loans. Rupee loans are given for financing land, building, civil works, \nindigenous plant and machinery, and so on while foreign loans are considered for meeting \nforeign currency expenditures towards the import of equipment and technical know-how.  \n(c) Debentures are debt instruments and they are convertible and non-convertible debentures. \nConvertible debentures are likely to be converted to equity wholly or partly as per the conversion \nrates fixed in advance. Non-convertible debentures normally carry fixed rate and having maturity \nperiod of 5 to 9 years.  \n(d) Deferred credits are credits offered by the suppliers of plant & machinery and the payments \ncan be made over a period of time as per the terms.  \n(e) Incentive sources include financial support as an incentive from government and other \nagencies to certain types of promoters or for setting up industrial units in certain locations. \nThese incentives may be in the form of Seed Capital Assistance or capital subsidy (to attract \nindustries) or tax deferment or exemption (particularly from GST) for a certain period.  \n(f) Miscellaneous Sources : A small portion of the project finance may come from miscellaneous \nsources like unsecured loans, public deposits, and leasing and hire purchase finance, etc.  \nOut of the total resources required, the quantum of equity financing and debt financing will be \nregulated by the debt-equity norm/promoters\u2019 contribution stipulated by financial institutions. \nDecision to raise resources from any source would require careful planning and cost benefit \nanalysis. These will be, of course, subject to regulatory approvals as necessary from SEBI etc. \nin case of raising debt or equity from the public.

It is therefore important to assess the viability of the \nbusiness activity of the unit of generating profits. To assess the debt servicing capacity the amount of \ncash surplus expected over the tenor of various long term loans is required to be estimated.  \nThese should be adequate to meet the annual loan instalment obligations. This is usually expressed as  \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio . \n(a) Viability of Business Activity: Assessing the viability of any business activity is essentially an exercise \nof working out projected sales and costs of production and cost of sales, etc. In other words, it is preparing \nprojected financial estimates for operations, as done for assessing the working capital requirements. The \nobjective here is to determine the profits and the cash surplus generated from the operations. While for \nworking capital assessment the projections for the following year are adequate, for term loan appraisal \npurposes such estimates are required for the entire tenor of the term loans.  \nTypically, the profit can be estimated from the estimates of the cost of production and cost of sales and  \nthe expected sales. The data elements that are required for this purpose are enumerated below:  \n\u2022 Installed capacity  \n\u2022 Number of shifts per day and number of working days  \n\u2022 Capacity utilisation plans  \n\u2022 Product mix  \n\u2022 Quantity and price of input  \n\u2022 Quantity and price of output  \n\u2022 Unit cost of production  \n\u2022 Labour costs  \n\u2022 Repairs and maintenance costs  \n\u2022 Plant overheads  \n\u2022 Administrative expenses  \n\u2022 Packing cost  \n\u2022 Selling expenses  \n\u2022 Financial expenses  \n\u2022 Depreciation  \n\u2022 Income tax  \n\u2022 Price rise and inflation, etc.  \nBased on these data elements and detailed working of each cost item the cost of production and cost of \nsales statement is prepared. Based on the expected sales projections the profit from sales is arrived at. \nThe net profit is determined after providing for taxes and any other non-business costs and provisions \nfor likely bad or doubtful debts.  \nTypical summarised cost of production and profits statement will look as shown in the illustration below.

DSCR is estimated for each year. The average DSCR (i.e. \nthe average of DSCRs calculated for the repayment period of the loan) of 1.50 is considered reasonable. \nThis ratio indicates that after payment of the loan instalment and interest something will be left over. \nThis margin of safety is what the lender looks for.  \nIt will be noticed that DSCR is a function of the liability on account of the instalment and interest payment \nobligations. Lower payment obligations will result in higher DSCR, indicating that the surplus generated \ncovers the payment obligations to a greater degree.  \nIt happens usually that in the initial years DSCR is less than 1.50. For providing some relief in these \nyears, the instalments at the beginning are kept lesser, and increased in later years as the income and \nprofitability improves. Alternatively, a longer repayment period can be considered. A higher DSCR of \nabove 2 indicates higher repayment capacity.

However, while doing so the average DSCR over the total \nrepayment tenor will also be kept in view.  \n \n23.7 LET US SUM UP  \nCredit appraisal is a process of critical evaluation of a loan request by a prospective borrower. An appraisal \nis undertaken for ensuring that a credit is good. It measures the risk inherent in the proposal and comes \nto judgment to sanction or reject the proposal based on the assessment of the information, the applicant \nand the project. Verification and validation are necessary to check out the facts. Bank should be able to \ndistinguish between relevant and irrelevant pieces of information. Default can occur because of business \nfailure or because the borrower\u2019s willful actions. The latter is a question of integrity of the borrower. At \ntimes less than optimal financial assistance by the lender or over financing could all lead to problems. \nCredit risk rating or credit rating is one of the credit appraisal tools.  \nThe credit decision for sanction or rejection of a proposal basically is based on: credit rating score; purpose \nof the loan; concentration limits etc. There are seven aspects (7 C\u2019s) for ascertaining - Creditworthiness, \nCharacter, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, Conditions, and Cash flows. Assessment of loans for different \npurposes is done in different manner as the factors affecting these differ in several respects.  \nThe capital required for a business enterprise can be classified under two main categories viz. (i) Fixed \nCapital; (ii) Working Capital. There are two concepts of working capital: (i) Gross working capital; (ii) \nNet working capital. Working Capital Gap is the difference between total Current Assets and Current \nLiabilities, other than bank borrowings. Banks try to fund the gap or extend need based financial assistance. \nThe duration from the purchase of raw materials through production to finished goods to sales and sales \nrealisation is the time period for which working capital funds are required.  \nBanks may adopt one of the following four methods for assessment of working capital requirements \nof their clients - (i) Turnover Method; (ii) Operating Cycle Method; (iii) Maximum Permissible Bank  ", "doc_id": "28866e01-e038-41da-929e-b5c1a7c27f7b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4cbcdb3ab0439f1f1431c880b3cd5eb00bf941171e63726b3b4222994f136cd1", "extra_info": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Appraisal_of_credit_facilities_1.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3431, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4bacf783-adfe-4161-b17b-0a01e41ac00c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0ac23c4-cfee-4f8e-a576-8ccd26aa6e1c": {"__data__": {"text": " \nAPPRAISAL AND ASSESEMENT OF CREDIT FACILITIES | 511  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinance (MPBF) Method (Projected Net Working Capital); and (iv) Cash Budget Method. The assessment \nof the working capital requirements of a firm must be preceded by a detailed appraisal of the past and \nfuture viability of the firm\u2019s planning, operations and financial position. Many banks continue to follow \nthe method of MPBF based on CMA (Credit Monitoring Arrangement) formats.  \nThe non-fund based limits are normally of two types: (i) bank guarantees and (ii) letters of credit. For \nassessing bank guarantee required by a borrower, details such as the nature of guarantee, its purpose, \nthe particulars of the contract period and the amount for which the guarantee is sought are collected and \nassessed from the aspect of creditworthiness of the customer and his relationship with the bank for \nsanctioning the guarantee facility. A letter of credit (L/C) is a written but a conditional undertaking given \nby the issuing bank on behalf of its customer, to the beneficiary that it will pay him the amount stated in \nthe credit provided documents specified in the letter of credit are drawn and presented in strict conformity \nwith the terms and conditions of the credit. A banker should ensure that the stocks procured through the \nL/C are taken under hypothecation, but are not included in the value of stocks for calculation of amount \nof drawals permitted (drawing power) for the fund based limits granted to the customer.  \nA term loan is granted for the purpose of acquisition of capital asset such as Land, Building, Plant & \nMachinery, Modernisation, renovation or rationalisation of plant. Term loans are also extended for \nacquisition of a capital asset like machinery, equipment, factory or office premises, vehicles, etc. on \nstandalone basis. Normally the term loans are repayable in instalments over a period ranging from 3 to \n10 years. The credit risk, therefore, is greater in case of term loan than in case of working capital finance. \nAssessment of project cost requires estimating the cost of acquisition of capital assets, cost of construction \nof building, and any other related expenditure. Besides, in the project cost the amount of working capital \nmargin required is also included as this is also to be funded from long term sources. To meet the cost of \nthe project, the following sources of finance are available: Share capital; Term loans; Debenture capital; \nDeferred credit; Incentive sources; Miscellaneous sources. It is important to assess the viability of the \nbusiness activity of the unit of generating profits. To assess the debt servicing capacity the amount of \ncash surplus expected over the tenor of various long term loans is required to be estimated.
